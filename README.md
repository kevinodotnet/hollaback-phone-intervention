Twilio
============================

I set this up in a few minutes using Twilio. You can do it too provided
you can get the 'voice.xml' and 'sms.xml' files uploaded to the web
somewhere (anywhere!).

Then just set the "Voice URL" and "SMS URL" on your newly acquired 
Twilio phone numbers. I am running the Ottawa numbers off my website,
so mine are:

http://app.kevino.ca/hollaback-phone-intervention/voice.xml

http://app.kevino.ca/hollaback-phone-intervention/sms.xml

It costs me $0.01 per call and $0.015 per text message to host this.

Ideally this doesn't add up to real money because there are hopefully
the ratio of stupid men to other men is declining over time.

Twilio is a 'web-based phone system'. More info http://twilio.com
